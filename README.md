Backend Communication Patterns in Node.js

This repository contains my implementations of various backend communication patterns in Node.js, including short polling, long polling, and server-sent events (SSE). The goal is to experiment with these patterns to understand their advantages and disadvantages in real-world applications.

Key Features

Node.js & Express: Implements various backend communication patterns using Node.js and Express.

Polling: Short polling and long polling strategies.

Server-Sent Events (SSE): Real-time unidirectional communication from the server to the client.
